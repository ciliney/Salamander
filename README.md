# Salamander
Python simulation of salamanders rendezvousing and changing colours

There are 30 salamanders living on an island. 15 are red, 7 are blue, 8 are green. Whenever two salamanders of a different color meet they both turn into the third color. Whenever two salamanders of the same color meet, each of them turns into one of the other two colors. So for example, if a red and green meet they both turn blue. If two blues meet then one will turn red and the other will turn green. Can you prove if it is ever possible at any time in the future that all salamanders will be red?
